# CS3520-COA: Assignment 1 - Reversible Prime Squares

A program that prints N reversible prime squares, where N is 10 in our case.
The program is implemented in c and MIPS assembly programming language wich in turn gets coverted to machine code (in Hexadecimal). 
A text file includes a machine code version of the program as per the MIPS assembly program.

A program turns to take a while to give outputs as the numbers get larger.
An observation was made that a lot of the time is spent in the isPrime() function - As per MIPS implementation and simulation. 
As such, this would be an authors first step in getting the program to be a bit faster in giving outputs.

Compilers Used:
1. gcc and g++

Assembly Language Used:
1. MIPS assembly for the MIPS processor (32-bit word instruction)

The comments/documentation in programs directly refer to a higher level implementation of the program
which simply implies that higher level versions are used as pseusocodes for lower level versions.
